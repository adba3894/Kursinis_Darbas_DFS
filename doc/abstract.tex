Goal of Distributed File System is to decentralize a network and make it more efficient by increasing files availability. Distributed File Systems were invented to make data exchanging more faster and comfortable.

This work will help to get familiar with possible types and architecture of Distributed File System. This work will focus on InterPlanetary File System and it will be analyzed in more detail. There will be also upload/download tests in this work in order to measure performance of IPFS system.
